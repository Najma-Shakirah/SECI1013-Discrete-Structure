# SECI1013-Discrete-Structure

<h2>Course summary</h2>
This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the field of computer science.We learnt set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Discrete structure built a foundation for me to understand basic algorithms and data structures that I will use in programming. It has also enhance my problem-solving skills as most of the problems discussed in this subject are based of real life. I wished that I had allocate my time more to do exercises and practices to understand this subject better as the subject is quite complex.
